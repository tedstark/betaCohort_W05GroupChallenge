GCU Java Programming Bootcamp, Day 24

//Create an application that cracks different kinds of shelled nuts.<br>
// To do this, you will need to create two different types of classes that we will call 'cracking machines'.<br>
// One will handle smaller shelled nuts, the other will handle larger shelled nuts.<br>
//For the two machines, use an abstract class for the two machine subclasses to inherit from.<br>
// Both machines should check a property of the shelled nut that it is given to ensure that it is the correct size.<br>
// If it is not, it should then be returned back to the main class to be given to the other machine to shell.<br>
//<br>
//The nuts should all use an interface or abstract class to ensure that it has all the appropriate members and<br>
//  methods associated to it.<br>
// Each nut will need to include a name, weight, and a String that will represent the sound the nut makes when<br>
//  it is shelled (or de-shelled rather).<br>
// Create a total of 5 shelled nut varieties for the two machines to crack open.<br>
//<br>
//The rest of the specifications of the application are up to your interpretation and design.<br>
//<br>
//At the end of the application, ensure that you instance one of each shelled nut,<br>
//  and pass them to the two machines for processing.<br>
// Also ensure to display to the user which shelled nut was cracked open in each machine.<br>
// Example "Machine 2 cracked open the Walnut with a 'Crrrrrrruuuuussssssh' sound".<br>
